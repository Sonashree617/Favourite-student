#FAVOURITE STUDENT
A **React JS** application that allows users to manage a list of students and mark them as favourites. This project demonstrates **React Router**, **Context API** for global state management, and **conditional rendering**.

Project Overview

- **Routing** with React Router

- **Global state management** with React Context (`useContext`)

- **Dynamic rendering** of data using `map()`

- **Conditional rendering** based on user interaction



The app allows users to view a list of students, mark them as favourites, and manage the favourite list efficiently.
